Writing emails to a stranger could be daunting, but it's a great way to build connections, explore opportunities, and even advance your career.

How do we write an effective cold email? 

Check out the thread below for some ideas.


## Contents

Your email should contain the following four elements. 

- Greeting: "Hello"
- Introduction: "My name is Inigo Montoya."
- Context/Connection: "You killed my father."
- Call for action: "Prepare to die."

## Greeting

Understand basic email etiquette. Do not use Miss / Mrs. particularly if you know the recipient has a PhD. Respect their expertise.

## Introduction

A simple one would work. My name is NAME. I am a POSITION from AFFILIATION. I am writing to WHAT DO YOU WANT

## Context
  
Provide SPECIFIC context, personal connection, background information in your email. Do your homework!

## Call for action
  
Spell out what you expect the recipient to do after reading the email. Make it ACTIONABLE (e.g., set up a short meeting, answer a question, or prepare to die).

## Consistent format
  
This pitfall is quite common in inquiry emails from prospective students. Ex:

"I am fascinated by your work <paper A> and <paper B>." where paper titles are of inconsistent font type/sizes. This almost surely indicates that you are sending massive emails.

## Your name
  
Make sure that you full name "in English" appears as the sender. Don't use your favorite anime character's name or some unmemorable ID (e.g., A90291053@school.edu).

## Make it clear and structured
  
Emails are not just plain texts. Make the main points stand out using bold/italic fonts. Itemize your talking points to make the email easier to read.

## Quality
  
For prospective students looking for advisors, remember that your email is a WRITING SAMPLE. If your email is not clear or has lots of errors, it could actually hurt your case. Revise the emails before you send them.

Dear Prof.

Greetings!!!. Hope you are doing well.

My name is Madan Baduwal. I am currently working as a Sr.Computer Vision and Software Engineer at BP Eye Foundation. I completed my undergraduate in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal in Oct 2019 with a merit scholarship and higher first-class. My major research project and paper was: “Signature Verification using Convolutional Neural Network and Autoencoder”. 

After 3 years of industrial research experience in computer vision and machine learning problems. I am looking for a potential lab where I can escalate my research i.e computer vision and machine learning. I found your profile from people doing research in computer vision and machine learning from google scholar. After carefully going through your personal website and reading your research papers “” and “”. I see a very good match with my area of expertise and future career. More especially I would like to work on 3D object detection, Image super-resolution, and Human action recognition.
 
I have attached my CV, paper, test score(TOEFL:101), and academic transcripts along with the email. I am truly hopeful and excited about an opportunity to work with you,
Looking forward to hearing from you,
 
Sincerely,
