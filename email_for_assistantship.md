Dear Prof. KC Santosh

Greetings!!!. Hope you are doing well.

I am fortunate, accepted to Graduate School at USD. My research interests lie in Machine Learning(ML), Deep Learning(DL), and Computer Vision(CV) for Medical Imaging. In particular ML, and DL paradigms for Medical Imaging. My research interest in-line with your research expertise and research happening at your lab "Applied Artificial Intelligence(2AI)" | previously "kc's PAMI Research Lab".

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art(SOTA) ML and DL architectures heavily rely on lengthy stored label datasets with challenges: data privacy, explainability, and ethical issues. The need of Active learning in medical imaging [1] and Federal learning-empowered medical imaging [2] are noticeable machine learning paradigms applied in medical imaging at your lab. The current breakthrough VICRegL method in self-supervised learning [3] shows promising results in image representation learning. But still, there is more to do where ML and DL can learn on the fly, directly from observations of the real world, rather than lengthy data collection and training processes. 

Contribution: My journal paper [4] was on supervised(i.e convolution ) and unsupervised(i.e Autoencoder) learning paradigms for Handwritten Signature image data. I am currently exploring ML and DL paradigms on semantic segmentation and detection algorithms for otitis media based on otoscopy images of the tympanic membrane. My contribution to the lab will be not only to circumscribe to explore current challenges in ML and DL. But also Data Mining, Big Data, Healthcare Informatics, (Bio)Medical Imaging, Pattern Recognition, Document Imaging, Biometrics, and Satellite Imaging with T shape skills.

Thank You
