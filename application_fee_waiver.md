Subject: Request for a waiver of the application fee
Respected Sir/Madam


I am writing to explain my financial hardship and request a waiver of my application fee for admission to your university.

I am Madan Baduwal from the western part of Nepal. My father is a farmer and my mother is a housewife. I completed my bachelor's in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University Nepal with a scholarship. Since childhood, I was fascinated by computers and I am doing research in machine learning and computer vision since my undergraduate(2015). I hope that I can be a researcher in the future. 

Currently, my family is struggling financially due to the flood in my hometown Kailali, which makes paying the application fee difficult for me. There is no income source in my family, and there are six people in my family. My father worked in the field and my mother is a housewife. It is difficult to manage application fees for them. 

I hope that you can consider my financial situation and allow me to get a fee waiver for my application.
