Dear Prof.Rabindra Khati
I hope you’re well. I’m in the process of applying to the University of South Dakota and want to ask if you feel comfortable writing a strong letter of recommendation on my behalf.
I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student. As my teacher, I believe you could honestly and effectively vouch for the hardworking I’ve demonstrated during our time together. 
I appreciate you considering my request. The deadline for submitting the letter is Oct 15. I’ve attached an updated version of my resume and Letter Of recommendation template. If you need any additional information, don’t hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you for your time and support.
Sincerely,
Madan Baduwal
