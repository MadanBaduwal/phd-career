Respected Professor,

I am writing this email to apply for the post of graduate research position you have shared recently  in your Linkedin profile.

I am an MS in CS applicant for fall 2022. It's been a long time since I have been waiting for the response of Assistantship  and Scholarship. But I haven't received any response from the department or university yet.

With a good academic background of 80.39% in BE in Computer Engineering and having working experience of about half year in Machine Learning & Data Science, I think I am competent enough for the scholarship.

I would be grateful if you consider my profile for the scholarship, assistantship, or any kind of waiver so it would be easier to pursue Masters's Degree at USD.

I have attached my CV & transcript for your reference. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely
